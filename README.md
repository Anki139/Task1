##This project is a dynamic Quiz Web Application designed to help users test their knowledge across multiple Computer Science subjects such as Computer Graphics, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Java Programming, DBMS, C Programming, and Data Structures. The application presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), provides instant feedback on each response, and visually displays the correct and incorrect answers with intuitive tick (‚úîÔ∏è) and cross (‚ùå) icons ‚Äî similar to the feedback system seen on platforms like YouTube.

Our goal with this project was to create an interactive, lightweight, and easy-to-use quiz interface using only front-end technologies. The quiz is ideal for self-assessment, revision before exams, and online testing during classes or mock interviews.

‚öôÔ∏è Functionality
The application dynamically performs the following tasks:

Loads and displays multiple-choice questions from a predefined JavaScript array.

Allows users to select an answer by clicking on one of the options.

Highlights correct answers with a green tick (‚úîÔ∏è) and incorrect answers with a red cross (‚ùå).

Locks answer options after a selection to prevent multiple attempts.

Displays immediate feedback (e.g., "Correct!" or "Wrong, try again").

Shows total score at the end of the quiz.

Provides a "Next Question" button to move through the quiz.

Offers a "Restart" option upon quiz completion.

The visual design emphasizes simplicity and clarity. Icons are implemented using inline SVG to ensure crisp, scalable feedback across all devices without relying on external assets.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This project uses the following technologies and platforms:

HTML5
Used to structure the content of the webpage, including containers for questions, choices, feedback, and navigation buttons.

CSS3
Used for styling and layout. The CSS ensures that elements are responsive, visually distinct (e.g., correct answers in green), and that buttons and feedback messages are styled for clarity and appeal.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
The core logic of the quiz is implemented in plain JavaScript. JavaScript is responsible for dynamically rendering questions, handling user input, applying feedback logic, managing state (e.g., score and current index), and updating the DOM based on interactions.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
Used for rendering cross and tick icons directly within the buttons. SVGs ensure high-quality rendering and easy styling.

Font Awesome (CDN)
Optionally included for additional icons or to explore further enhancements, though our solution mainly uses inline SVGs for flexibility.

üíª Platform & Execution
This quiz app is a client-side application, which means:

It runs entirely in the browser.

No server or database setup is required.

It works offline once loaded.

It can be hosted on any static web hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

You simply need:

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

The project folder containing index.html, style.css, and script.js

To run the application, just open index.html in your browser.

üìà Learning Objectives & Outcomes
By developing this project, we have explored:

DOM manipulation using JavaScript

Event handling and user interaction

Dynamic UI feedback using icons and color coding

Efficient layout design using CSS

Use of inline SVG graphics for scalable and responsive icons

Structuring modular and readable code for real-time user feedback

This project not only solidifies core front-end development skills but also provides a practical understanding of how to create intuitive educational tools using web technologies.
